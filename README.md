# Raylib Tetris - A custom C++ implementation

This project is my take on the classic Tetris game, built in C++ with a focus on minimal dependencies. Initially inspired by a tutorial, I’ve hacked and ventured off-script multiple times to explore my own logic and solutions while deliberately avoiding STL libraries for a leaner, more hands-on approach.
I’m still learning, so some parts might be rough. Any and all feedback is welcome!
